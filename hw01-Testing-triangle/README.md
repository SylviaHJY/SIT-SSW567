# Unittest-SSW567
Testing triangleclassification
equilateral triangles have all three sides with the same length
isosceles triangles have two sides with the same length
scalene triangles have three sides with different lengths
right triangles have three sides with lengths, a, b, and c where a2 + b2 = c2


These are your Requirements Specifications for this program:

“Write a function classify_triangle() that takes three  parameters: a, b, and c. The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.”

Hint:  Write a function called classify_triangle(a, b, c) where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangles.   You may either allow the user to enter values that you pass to classify_triangle() or your "main" routine can just invoke classify_triangle() with values.   This approach allows you to easily invoke classify_triangle() from your test framework.

You will not be graded on how well you write the program, but do try to do a decent job.  You may want to include a few bugs in your program to demonstrate that your test script is working properly and is able to find problems.
